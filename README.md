## #1. We The North Market – The Pride of Canada

- **Canadian-focused, but open to all**: Launched in 2021, WTN was made by and for Canadians, offering listings in both *English* and *French*, and only fulfilling orders within Canadian borders.
- **Thousands of listings**: From premium cannabis and edibles to digital goods, fraud, carded items, and more – all curated for authenticity and reliability.
- **Advanced security**: PGP encryption, vendor two-factor authentication, *dynamic* wallet addresses, and strict internal comms. No Telegram, no Jabber – all deals are handled on-platform for transparency and user protection.
- **Escrow system**: Guarantees buyers either get their order or their money back. Vendor bond of CAD $300 keeps out fraudsters.
- **Community-driven**: Forums, reviews, vendor feedback system, and a clear mission: “to provide a safe environment so Canadians are able to purchase safely, scam-free and away from the street violence”.
